# Week4-Facebook
<b> Overview - </b>
In this project, I've done a lot of optional milestones and more. In the spirit of experimenting with custom transitions, I've re-created the current facebook experience of viewing albums. 
  
<b> Tasks Completed - </b>
All tasks and milestones of the assignment were completed including the following optional tasks...
- When you tap on an image from a post in the news feed, it first transitions to an album view where user can scroll through all the photos
- I used custom transitions and x-code tag'ing to accomplish the above
- From the album view, when you taps on any image, it transitions to a single photo view of just that image
- Here you can pinch zoom (I implemented the scroll view zoom)
- In both album and single photo view, scrolling vertically allows you to dismiss the view


<b> Time spent - </b>
I spent a good 14-15 hours doing this assignment over the course of three days (Thu - Sat).
